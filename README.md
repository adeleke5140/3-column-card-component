# 3-column-card-component
This challenge was pretty unique and interesting. I was calm and collected while building it. My plan was to implement all the CSS best practices I had recently read about. 
I wouldn't say it was particularly challenging but it definitely gave me a couple things to think about.
One of those issues was trying to figure out why the media query wasn't working like it was supposed to and also the hover pseduo class that was giving me a couple of headache.
